# Meeting Notes
Notes taken at our meetings.

The project started on Monday, 2025-05-19

## **Wednesday 2025-05-28**
We are working on creating questions and answers taken from PDF with SWedish text.
This will form the baseline data that will use in the project. The goal is to use
the data as a baseline and improve upon it as we go along.

The README.md file shall contain the complete documentation of the steps that we
have finished. At the moment we are working on creating data. One this step is
completed the documention of this step will be added to README.md.

It is important that make sure that every PDF document has a unique file name.
Some sources rename the files to the same name when you download a file. In these
cases we have to change the file names so they are unique.
